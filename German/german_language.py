    "When used in the sense of 'to do', machen and tun are often - but not always - replaceable.",
    """Unterrichten means teaching by low-level teachers (e.g. private tutors and higschool
    teachers), whereas lehren means teaching by high-level teachers (e.g. university professor).""",
    """Fühlen without sich seems to be rarely used, appearing in sentences like 'I can't feel my
    hands' or 'I feel your pain as if it was my pain'.""",
    """Schauen and sehen are often (colloquially) used to mean 'to watch / look at', but only when
    there is no possible confusion with the actual meaning of 'to look / see'. For example, in
    English you can 'watch a movie' or 'watch your children'. You can say 'I saw a movie', because a
    movie is always something you watch, but you wouldn't say 'I saw my children' with the meaning
    of 'I watch my children', because those are two diffrent things.""",
    """Sich anziehen means to put on clothes, whereas sich kleiden is about dressing with a
    particular fashing style.""",
    """Both bieten and anbieten mean 'to offer', but anbieten is for a particular concrete offer
    between people (think of a commercial deal), whereas bieten is a broader term (e.g. Life offers
    many opportunities to those who look for them.).""",
    """Both wählen and auswählen mean 'to choose / select / pick', but wählen is used in a
    non-specific manner (e.g. When going on holiday I choose mountains over the sea), whereas
    auswählen is about choosing a particular option from a limited set of choices (e.g. I always
    choose this hotel when staying in Berlin). In some situations, both words are acceptable.""",
    "Möchten is not a verb of its own. Rather, it is the Konjunktiv Präteritum form of mögen.",
    """Some verbs have prefixes which are moved to the end of the sentence in the present tense, for
    example: mitnehmen -> Ich nehme mein Handy mit. Note that not all prefixes are separable this
    way, for example: verkaufen -> Ich verkaufe Bücher. There are also prefixes which are sometimes
    separable and sometimes non-separable: durch, über, um, unter, wieder.""",
    # Pronunciation
    "If a words ends with b, d, or g, these letter are pronounced as p, t, k.",
    "Most words in German are accented on the first syllable",
    "German 'r' is like the Dutch 'g' - it is spoken from deep within the throat",
    """Ü is pronounced like a long 'u' with a high note, ö like a long 'u' with a low note, and ä
    like a short 'e'.""",
    """When the letter 'e' in German is located in an open stressed syllable (i.e. when there are no
    consonants at the end), it is pronounced as 'ej' (e.g. Wesen = 'wejsen'). The problem is: What
    if you want the short 'e'? Use 'ä' instead.""",
    """If after a vowel (aeiouöäü) there are two identical letters, the vowel is always short.
    If there is h after the vowel, it is always long.""",
    # Adverbs
    """Both wenn and als mean 'when'. Als is used for the past (certainty), whilst wenn is used for
    the future, present, theoretical pasts, and wishes (uncertainty). Wenn thus also simultaneously
    means 'if', but note that the word 'if' in English carries a very large number of connotations,
    which are split across different words in German.""",
    """Ob means 'whether' and dass means 'that', in the sense of 'I didn't know that it would rain'.
    The former is thus used in questions and the latter in statements.""",
    """Both denn and weil mean 'because', with denn also having other meanings. The difference
    between them is that denn does not affect the sentence structure, whilst weil makes the verb
    move to the end of the clause: 'Sie geht jeden tag spazieren, denn sie hat einen Hund.' vs 'Sie
    geht jeden tag spazieren, weil sie einen Hund hat.'. Additionally, sentences can't begin with
    denn, but can with weil.""",
    """The English word 'too' was originally a stressed version of 'to' and English decided to
    capture that in a spelling difference. German didn't bother, and so zu is both the words 'to'
    and 'too'.""",
    """Bereits is more common in writing, whilst schon is more common in speech. Schon is also often
    used as a modal particle, in the case which it means 'indeed'.""",
    "Wider and weider are pronounced exactly the same.",
    """Nie and niemals both mean never and are largely interchangeable, with niemals carrying
    stronger emphasis (like 'never ever').""",
    # Miscellanous
    """Ordinal numbers (first, second, etc.) are created from cardinal numbers (one, two) by adding
    the ending 'te' to them for numbers from 1 to 19, and 'ste' for numbers from 20 upwards. There
    are four exceptions: erste (1st), dritte (3rd), siebte (7th), achte (8th). Be careful - instead
    of using st / rd / th, in German you denote ordinal numbers by putting a full stop after them
    (e.g., Der 1. Mai ist ein Feiertag in Deutschland.).""",
    """When talking about inanimate objects using personal pronouns (er/sie/es), you must use
    'da-words'. For example, 'Ich träume von ihr (die Party)' is incorrect and 'Ich träume davon
    (die Party)' is correct. Davon is made from the prefix 'da' + linker word 'von'. Other examples
    are: damit, dafür, dadurch, danach, etc. In cases when the linker word begins with a vowel
    (aeiouöäü), you should use the prefix 'dar': darüber, darum, darunter, darauf. Da-words are
    useful because they ignore grammatical gender and cases, but unfortunately they can not used
    when referring to living objects - 'Ich spiele damit (der Katze)' is wrong.""",
    """The prefix 'irgend' is used to make a family of adverbs relating to 'some-ness'. For example,
    irgendwo - somewhere, irgendwann - some time, irgendwie - somehow, irgendwas - something,
    irgendwer - someone. Irgendwas carries a connotation of vagueness when compared to etwas - it is
    like a mix of something + anything.""",
    # Verb conjugation
    """Many verbs that end in 'ieren' don't get a 'ge' prefix in Perfekt (e.g., studieren, rotieren,
    tapezieren). But then that's only for verbs adapted from Latin/French - when it comes to verbs
    like 'zieren', 'schmieren', 'gieren', which are Germanic, then you do get the 'ge'.""",
    """For verbs with prefixes, the special rule is that if it is a separable prefix, the 'ge' is
    inserted between prefix and stem, so feststecken -> festgesteckt. If it is an inseparable
    prefix, there is no 'ge'.""",
    """The only rule - never broken - is about accent. The prefix 'ge' goes on verbs immediately
    before the accented syllable. If the first syllable is unaccented, there is no 'ge'. All those
    borrowed verbs with 'ieren' have the accent on the 'ieren', and so they have one or more
    unaccented syllables before that. That means they can't take 'ge'. Native words have no
    syllables before the syllable in 'ieren', so the accent is on the first syllable of the word,
    and they can take the 'ge'. Words with a prefix can't take 'ge' if the prefix is unaccented. So
    no verb that begins 'ver' or 'zer' can take 'ge', because 'ver' and 'zer' can't take the accent.
    If the prefix does take the accent, it is a separable prefix, so it splits off and the 'ge' goes
    in the middle.""",
    """In Prasens, irregularly-conjugated verbs have the same suffixes & prefixes as regular verbs,
    but they experience letter changes in the verb's stem. These changes (a > ä, e > i, e > ie)
    usually occur just for du + er/sie/es. An exception are the six modal verbs (können, müssen,
    dürfen, wollen, sollen, mögen), where all the singular forms have stem changes and ich +
    er/sie/es have no suffixes. Lastly, the verbs sein, haben, werden, and wissen have fully
    irregular single forms, and sein also (uniquely) has an irregular plural form.
    """,
    """Perfekt is used mostly in conversational contexts in German and Präteritum is used mostly in
    written German. For this reason, the 2nd person forms (du, ihr, Sie) are very uncommon in
    Präteritum and sound strange to the ear of a native speaker - it is odd to narrate directly to a
    person what he or she did at some past time. An exception are the 6 modal verbs, sein, haben,
    werden, and wissen, for which Präteritum is preferred over Perfekt even in spoken German.""",
    """In Präsens, verb stems that end with d / t, or m / n following a consonant (other than l/r)
    gain an additional 'e' before t / st suffixes (e.g., arbeiten -> du arbeitest, zeichnen -> es
    zeichnet). Verbs whose stems end in s/ß/x/z drop the 's' from the 'st' prefix.""",
    """In Präteritum the suffixes follow almost the same rules as in Präsens (although er/sie/es
    switch to the ich suffix) with an additional 'te' at the beginning of each suffix. If this were
    to result in two 'e's next to each other, one 'e' is dropped (e.g., tanzen -> Sie tanzten)."""
