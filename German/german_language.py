    verbs are those that require / very often take a direct object, e.g. "I destroyed a chair". It
    is possible to just say "I destroyed", but that is not how the verb is usually employed (so it

    (e.g. 'The light shone', 'We were running', 'He died'). Intransitive verbs are far less common
    than transitive, and as a rule of thumb they relate to movement or change of state. Note that
    'sich' counts as a direct object, e.g. Ich habe mich gefreut. Moreover, when an intransitive

    unaccented syllables before that. That means they can't take 'ge'. Native words have no
    syllables before the syllable in 'ieren', so the accent is on the first syllable of the word,
    and they can take the 'ge'. Words with a prefix can't take 'ge' if the prefix is unaccented. So
    no verb that begins 'ver' or 'zer' can take 'ge', because 'ver' and 'zer' can't take the accent.
