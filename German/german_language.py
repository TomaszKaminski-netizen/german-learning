    many opportunities to those who look for them.).""",

    non-specific manner (e.g. When going on holiday I choose mountains over the sea), whereas

    mitnehmen -> Ich nehme den Ball mit). These are: ab, an, auf, aus, ein, los, mit, nach, vor, zu.

    are four exceptions: erste (1st), dritte (3rd), siebte (7th), achte (8th). Be careful - instead

    'da-words'. For example, 'Ich träume von ihr (die Party)' is incorrect and 'Ich träume davon
    (die Party)' is correct. Davon is made from the prefix 'da' + linker word 'von'. Other examples
    are: damit, dafür, dadurch, danach, etc. In cases when the linker word begins with a vowel

    'e' is added before s/st endings (e.g. laden -> lädst).""",

    logic as in Präsens). However, irregular verbs often end with 'en' rather than 't/et' and have
    stem letter changes, which are different than the changes in Präsens. In all cases, the main
    verb does not change depending on the person - instead an auxiliary verb (either haben or sein)

    verbs are those that require / very often take a direct object, e.g. "I destroyed an object". It
    is possible to just say "I destroyed", but that is not how the verb is usually employed (so it
    still pairs with haben). Intransitive verbs either can't or don't need to have a direct object
    (e.g. 'The light shone', 'We were running', 'He died'). Intransitive verbs are far less common
    than transitive, and as a rule of thumb they relate to movement or change of state. Note that
    'sich' counts as a direct object, e.g. Ich habe mich gefreut. Moreover, when an intransitive
    verb (I flew by plane -> Ich bin mit dem Flugzeug geflogen) is used in a transitive way (I flew
    the plane -> Ich habe das Flugzeug geflogen) it switches to haben.""",

    Furthermore, many verbs that end in 'ieren' do not receive 'ge' (e.g. studieren, rotieren,
    tapezieren). However, these are verbs adapted from Latin/French - when it comes to Germanic
    verbs like 'zieren', 'schmieren', 'gieren', you do get the 'ge'.""",
    """The only rule - never broken - is about accent. The prefix 'ge' goes on verbs immediately
    before the accented syllable. If the first syllable is unaccented, there is no 'ge'. All those
    borrowed verbs with 'ieren' have the accent on the 'ieren', and so they have one or more
    unaccented syllables before that. That means they can't take 'ge'. Native words have no
    syllables before the syllable in 'ieren', so the accent is on the first syllable of the word,
    and they can take the 'ge'. Words with a prefix can't take 'ge' if the prefix is unaccented. So
    no verb that begins 'ver' or 'zer' can take 'ge', because 'ver' and 'zer' can't take the accent.
    If the prefix does take the accent, it is a separable prefix, so it splits off and the 'ge' goes
    in the middle.""",

    For this reason, the 2nd person forms (du, ihr, Sie) are very uncommon in Präteritum and sound
    strange to the ear of a native speaker - it is odd to narrate directly to a person what he or
    she did at some past time. An exception are the 6 modal verbs, sein, and haben, for which
    Präteritum is preferred over Perfekt even in spoken German.""",

    umlaut. As could be expected, sein is fully irregular: seien Sie / seien wir / seid (ihr) /
    sei (du). Moreover, the six modal verbs do not possess an Imperativ form. Finally, in Imperativ
    the verb goes before the personal pronoun, with ihr & du pronouns often omitted, and any
    separable prefix goes to the end of the sentence.""",
    # Nouns
    """Plural nouns are formed in many ways, the most common of which are: no change, 'e' suffix,

    speaking, 80% masculine and 75% neuter nouns take the 'e' plural, whilst 90% feminine nouns take
    the 'en/n' plural. The 's' suffix is given to people's names/surnames, abbreviations, and many
    nouns with roots in English, Dutch or French. All feminine nouns gain a suffix and / or umlaut,
    as otherwise the plural form would be indistinguishable from the singular form. Lastly, all
    nouns ending with 'e' gain an 'n'. As in English, some nouns do not have a plural form.""",

    'heit', 'keit', 'ung', 'schaft', or 'tät' are always feminine, whereas those ending with 'ich',
    'ig', or 'ling' are nearly always masculine. Nouns ending with 'chen' or 'lein' are neuter, as
