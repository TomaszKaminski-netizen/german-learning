    -> trittst/tritt), and o > ö (stoßen -> stößt). Additionally, when the a > ä change occurs, no
    'e' is added before s/st endings (e.g. laden -> lädst).""",

    logic as in Präsens). However, irregular verbs often end with 'en' rather than 't/et' and have
    stem letter changes, which are different than the changes in Präsens. In all cases, the main
    verb does not change depending on the person - instead an auxiliary verb (either haben or sein)

    verbs are those that require / very often take a direct object, e.g. 'I destroyed a chair'. It

    still pairs with haben. Intransitive verbs either can't or don't need to have a direct object
    (e.g. 'The light shone', 'We were running', 'He died'). Intransitive verbs are far less common

    the verb goes before the personal pronoun, with ihr & du pronouns often omitted, and any
    separable prefix goes to the end of the sentence. This means that for plural persons, a sentence

    order, the new direct object is identified by either von (for living beings / organisations) or
    durch (for inanimate things). Only sentences with transitive verbs can be converted into passive
    voice, due to the requirement of a direct object. However, the passive voice is rare in spoken
    German, with people preferring to instead use the indefinite pronoun 'man' (e.g. 'Das hatte man
