# German learning

This repository contains a standalone Python 3 script that runs a simple GUI application for learning German vocabulary as an English speaker. I developed this app to self-study German, progressing from a novice up to B1 level, as assessed by Goethe-Institut examination. The app currently tracks over a thousand of the most common German verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, and provides useful grammar tips. It can also test declension and verb conjugation.

## Setup

The app was developed with Python 3.8.0, Requests 2.25.1, Beautifulsoup4 4.11.2, and PyGame 2.1.3. It has not been tested for version compatibility, so itâ€™s recommended to create a virtual environment with these specific versions to avoid issues. The app requires an internet connection to test verb conjugation, but otherwise it can run offline. The code is compatible with both Windows and Linux.

## Usage

Before using the application for the first time, delete the *memory.json* file to start tracking your German learning progress from a blank slate. Then simply run the *learning_germany.py* script from a command line or IDE and a popup window will appear, with largely self-explanatory buttons & options. The app can be adapted to fit your learning needs by opening the *german_language.py* file and editing the dictionaries found within.
